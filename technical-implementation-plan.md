# Technical Implementation Analysis
## High-Level Architecture Overview

### Core Components Required

1. Smart Contract Layer
   - ERC-20 token contracts for stablecoins (EQEUR, EQUSD, EQGBP, EQCHF)
   - Equity token contracts with transfer restrictions and compliance hooks
   - Exchange contract handling order matching and settlement
   - Custodial contract managing asset backing

2. Infrastructure Requirements
   - Ethereum nodes (main + backup)
   - Layer 2 scaling solution integration
   - IPFS nodes for decentralized document storage
   - Secure cold storage system
   - High-availability database cluster
   - Load-balanced API servers

3. Security Architecture
   - Multi-signature wallet implementation
   - Hardware security modules (HSM)
   - Real-time transaction monitoring
   - Automated compliance checking
   - Rate limiting and DDos protection

### Implementation Phases

Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure
