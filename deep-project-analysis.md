## 4. Cost Optimization Approaches

### Team Structure Optimization
```yaml
Junior-Senior Mix:
  Senior (60%):
    - Architecture decisions
    - Code review
    - Critical components
  
  Mid-level (30%):
    - Feature development
    - Testing
    - Integration work
    
  Junior (10%):
    - Tool development
    - Documentation
    - Testing automation
```

### Infrastructure Cost Control
```yaml
Development Environment:
  - Use spot instances
  - Implement auto-scaling
  - Regular resource cleanup
  - Development-specific constraints

Staging Environment:
  - Shared resources
  - Limited uptime
  - Reduced redundancy
  - Cost monitoring

Production Environment:
  - Reserved instances
  - Resource optimization
  - Performance monitoring
  - Automatic scaling
```

### Quality-Speed-Cost Triangle
```yaml
High Quality Focus:
  Timeline: 18-20 months
  Team Size: 25-30
  Cost: Full budget
  
Balanced Approach:
  Timeline: 15-17 months
  Team Size: 20-25
  Cost: 85% of budget
  
Fast Track:
  Timeline: 12-14 months
  Team Size: 30-35
  Cost: 130% of budget
  
Minimum Viable Product:
  Timeline: 9-10 months
  Team Size: 15-20
  Cost: 60% of budget
```
