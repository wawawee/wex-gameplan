```

Would you like me to:
1. Provide specific implementation details for any of these components?
2. Create detailed architectural diagrams?
3. Develop specific test scenarios?
4. Break down the performance optimization strategies further?
5. Elaborate on the compliance framework?

Let me know which aspects you'd like to explore in more detail.
