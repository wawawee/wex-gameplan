    - Risk mitigation
    
  Quality Control:
    - Code review process
    - Testing procedures
    - Documentation standards
```

### 2. Risk Management
```yaml
Risk Areas:
  Technical Risks:
    - Regular security audits
    - Performance monitoring
    - System redundancy
    
  Operational Risks:
    - Team training
    - Process documentation
    - Emergency procedures
    
  Compliance Risks:
    - Regulatory monitoring
    - Audit preparation
    - Documentation maintenance
```

### 3. Success Metrics
```yaml
Performance Metrics:
  System Performance:
    - Transaction throughput
    - System latency
    - Error rates
    
  Security Metrics:
    - Incident response time
    - Vulnerability detection
    - Resolution time
    
  Compliance Metrics:
    - KYC completion rates
    - Report accuracy
    - Regulatory compliance
```

Would you like me to:
1. Create a detailed implementation schedule for any specific phase?
2. Develop specific team allocation plans?
3. Design detailed testing scenarios?
4. Create operational procedures for post-launch?

The key to successful implementation is maintaining strict version control of all documentation and code, ensuring clear communication channels between teams, and having robust project management oversight throughout the process.
