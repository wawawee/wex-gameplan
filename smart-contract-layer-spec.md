# Smart Contract Layer - Detailed Technical Specification

## 1. Stablecoin Token Contracts (ERC-20)

### Core Implementation
```solidity
// Base stablecoin implementation
contract EQStablecoin is ERC20, Pausable, AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");
    bytes32 public constant BURNER_ROLE = keccak256("BURNER_ROLE");
    
    uint256 public constant EXCHANGE_RATE_DECIMALS = 8;
    uint256 public exchangeRate;  // Rate with EXCHANGE_RATE_DECIMALS precision
    
    mapping(address => bool) public blacklisted;
    
    event ExchangeRateUpdated(uint256 newRate);
    event AccountBlacklisted(address account);
    event AccountWhitelisted(address account);
}
```

### Key Features
1. Exchange Rate Management
   - Oracle integration for price feeds
   - Rate update cooldown periods
   - Emergency rate freeze capability
   - Historical rate tracking

2. Access Control System
   - Multi-signature requirement for critical operations
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Time-locked administrative actions
   - Emergency pause functionality

3. Compliance Features
   - Transaction monitoring hooks
   - Blacklist/whitelist functionality
   - Volume limits and velocity checks
   - Regulatory reporting capabilities

## 2. Equity Token Smart Contract

### Base Implementation
```solidity
contract EquityToken is ERC20, AccessControl {
    struct TokenMetadata {
        string companyName;
        string symbol;
        uint256 totalShares;
        address custodian;
        bool transfersPaused;
    }
    
    TokenMetadata public metadata;
    mapping(address => bool) public authorizedTraders;
    mapping(address => uint256) public tradingLimits;
    
    // Compliance hooks
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public transferApprovals;
}
```

### Key Components
1. Share Management
   - Dynamic total supply adjustments
   - Share class implementation
   - Dividend distribution capability
   - Corporate action handling

2. Trading Controls
   - Transfer restrictions
   - Trading hour limitations
   - Volume restrictions
   - Market maker privileges

3. Corporate Actions
   - Stock split handling
   - Merger/acquisition support
   - Rights issue implementation
   - Share buyback functionality

## 3. Exchange Contract

### Core Architecture
```solidity
contract ExchangeContract {
    struct Order {
        uint256 id;
        address trader;
        address token;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 price;
        uint256 timestamp;
        OrderType orderType;
        OrderStatus status;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Order) public orders;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public balances;
    
    event OrderCreated(uint256 indexed orderId, address indexed trader);
    event OrderMatched(uint256 indexed buyOrderId, uint256 indexed sellOrderId);
}
```

### Critical Features
1. Order Management
   - Limit order implementation
   - Market order processing
   - Order book maintenance
   - Partial fill handling

2. Settlement System
   - Atomic swaps
   - Failed transaction handling
   - Settlement confirmation
   - Dispute resolution support

3. Market Making
   - Liquidity pool integration
   - Automated market making
   - Price discovery mechanism
   - Slippage protection

## 4. Custodial Contract

### Implementation
```solidity
contract CustodialContract is AccessControl {
    struct Asset {
        address tokenContract;
        uint256 totalAmount;
        mapping(address => uint256) balances;
        bool frozen;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => Asset) public assets;
    mapping(address => bool) public trustedCustodians;
    
    event AssetDeposited(bytes32 indexed assetId, address depositor, uint256 amount);
    event AssetWithdrawn(bytes32 indexed assetId, address recipient, uint256 amount);
}
```

### Security Features
1. Asset Protection
   - Multi-signature requirements
   - Time-locked withdrawals
   - Emergency freeze capability
   - Audit trail maintenance

2. Access Management
   - Custodian verification
   - Authorization levels
   - Activity monitoring
   - Automated compliance checks

### Testing Requirements

1. Unit Testing
   - Individual contract function testing
   - Edge case verification
   - Gas optimization checks
   - Security vulnerability testing

2. Integration Testing
   - Cross-contract interaction testing
   - Network stress testing
   - Oracle integration verification
   - Failure mode testing

3. Security Auditing
   - Static code analysis
   - Dynamic testing
   - Formal verification
   - Penetration testing
